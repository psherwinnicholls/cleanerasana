# Cleaner Asana
I noticed that Asana is visually quite complicated, especially to those who are new to task management. To help with this I've created a Chrome Extension which simplifies the UI to hopefully reduce the cognitive load of someone trying to organise their tasks!

## Install and use
<!-- [Download Cleaner Asana on the Chrome Webstore]() -->
Coming soon

## Run locally
1. `git clone git@github.com:psherwinnicholls/cleanerasana.git`
2. Open Chrome
3. Click the three dots next to the URL bar
4. Navigate to `More Tools > Extensions` or type `chrome://extensions/` into the URL bar
5. Turn on Developer Mode (top right)
6. Click `LOAD UNPACKED`
7. Upload this folder

To see any changes you make live, you'll need to refresh the extension in the extensions page
